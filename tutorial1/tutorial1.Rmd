# Course objective
* The key objective of the course is **applying** microeconometric techniques rather than **deriving** econometric and statistical properties of estimators
* In other words, there’s way less of this:

\begin{align*}
  \text{plim} \hat{\beta}_{OLS} = \beta + \text{plim} (\frac{1}{N}X'X)^{-1} \text{plim} \frac{1}{N} X' \varepsilon = \beta + Q^{-1} \text{plim} \frac{1}{N} X' \varepsilon
\end{align*}

* And way more of this:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(fixest)

tb <- tibble(groups = sort(rep(1:10, 600)), 
             time = rep(sort(rep(1:6, 100)), 10),
             Treated = I(groups > 5) * I(time > 3),
             Y = groups + time + Treated * 5 + rnorm(6000))
m <- feols(Y ~ Treated | groups + time, data = tb)
```

If you would like to go deeper into the former, take Advanced Econometrics I and II next year

# Censored regression

- Censoring occurs when the value of a variable is limited due to some constraint
- For example, we tend not to see wages below the federal minimum wage
- In this case OLS estimates are biased
- A standard method to account for censoring is to combine a probit with OLS, i.e. tobit-model

---

# Censored regression: simulation

- The clearest way to understand how a certain estimator works is to generate data yourself so you know the true **data generating process** - DGP
- Let's estimate returns to education: does education increase wages?
- But suppose that we do not observe wages below a specific threshold (can happen due to privacy concerns, coding, etc.)
- We need to generate data containing years of education and wages

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Alsways set seed so you can replicate your results
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(education = runif(1000, 5, 15),
             wage_star = 500 + 150*education + rnorm(1000, 0, 100),
             wage = ifelse(wage_star < 1500, 1500, wage_star))  %>%
  arrange(desc(wage_star))
```

---

# Censored regression: simulation

- Let's look at the head and tail of our dataset

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(df)
tail(df)
```

---

# Censored regression: OLS

Now let's pretend that we do not know the DGP and simply apply OLS

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ols_model <- lm(wage ~ education, df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(ols_model, stars = TRUE,  gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

- Using these OLS estimates, we would conclude that "an additional year of education is associated with `r round(ols_model$coefficients[2], 3)` increase in monthly wages"

---

# Censored regression: tobit-model

- But these are biased estimates since we know the true effect is $150$ (remember DGP)
- Let's try to recover unbiased effects of education on wages by using tobit-model
- The solution provided by the tobit-model is to
  - use a probit to account for the censoring 
  - estimate OLS on the non-censored data
- Tobit-model estimator is easy to implement with `censReg` package 

---

# Censored regression: tobit-model

Remember that we have left censored wages: wages below $1500$ are coded as $1500$

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(censReg)
tobit_model <- censReg(wage ~ education, data = df, left = 1500)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(tobit_model, stars = TRUE,  gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

We recovered the unbiased estimates of returns to education

---

# Censored regression: graphically

We are going to use a lot of graphs since they provide more intuition of what is happening in the regression models

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = education, y = wage)) + 
  theme_light() +
  geom_point(aes(color = 'dark grey')) +
  geom_abline(color = 'red', intercept = ols_model[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]], slope = ols_model[["coefficients"]][["education"]]) + 
  geom_abline(color = 'blue', intercept = tobit_model[["estimate"]][["(Intercept)"]], slope = tobit_model[["estimate"]][["education"]]) + 
  ylim(c(1250, 3000)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "", values = c("Observed data" = "dark grey", 
                                                   "OLS" = "red",
                                                   "Tobit" = "blue"))
```

---

# Censored regression: some remarks

- You can specify both left and right censoring using `censReg` function
- Important assumption of the tobit-model is that the unobserved term is normally distributed (which is the case in our simulated dataset)
- If the data is missing not because the outcome variable is **above (or below)** some threshold but because individuals in the data have made a **choice** such that we can't observe their outcome variable, we can't use censoring
- Censoring cannot be applied because the availability of data is influenced by the choice of agents (i.e. selection on unobservables)
- It is a typical sample selection problem

---

# Sample selection model

- Let us consider the case of studying female’s wages
- Usually, wages are observed for a fraction of women in the sample, whereas the remaining part of women are observed as unemployed or inactive
- If we run OLS regression using the observed wages, this would deliver consistent estimations only if working females are a random sample of the population
- However,theory of labor supply suggests that this may not be the case, since (typically) female labor supply is sensitive to household decisions
- That is, female workers self-select into employment, and the self-selection is not random
- This difference may lead us to underestimate the gender wage gap

---

# Sample selection model

- Suppose a female worker decides to work or not $I_i^*$ depending on a set of observed $Z_i$ and unobserved $V_i$ characteristics

\begin{align*}
  I_i^* = Z_i ' \gamma + V_i
\end{align*}

- This indicator function (decision to work or not) takes two values

\begin{align*}
  I_i = \begin{cases} \mbox{} 1 \text{ (working) } \ & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i^* > 0 \\ \mbox{} 0 \text{ (not working) } & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i^* \leq 0 \end{cases}
\end{align*}

- Suppose there is a latent outcome $Y_i^*$, i.e. wages of female workers, which depend on a set of observed $X_i$ and unobserved $U_i$ characteristics

\begin{align*}
  Y_i^* = X_i ' \beta + U_i
\end{align*}

- However, we observe wages only for females who decided to work. $Y_i$ are observed wages that equal to

\begin{align*}
  Y_i = \begin{cases} \mbox{} Y_i^* \ & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i = 1 \\ \mbox{} \text{missing} & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i = 0 \end{cases}
\end{align*}

---

# Sample selection model: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(mvtnorm) # to simulate bivariate normal random variable
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(z = runif(100),
             x = runif(100),
             uv = rmvnorm(100, mean = c(0, 0), 
                  sigma = rbind(c(1, 0.5), c(0.5, 1))),
             i_star = 4 - 5 * z + uv[, 1],
             y_star = 6 - 3 * x + uv[, 2],
             y = ifelse(i_star > 0, y_star, 0))
head(df)
```

---

# Sample selection model: simulation

The true effect of $Z$ on $I$ (decision to work) is $-5$ and the true effect $X$ on $Y$ (wages) is $-3$ 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
selection_equation <- glm(I(y > 0) ~ z, df, family = binomial(link = "probit"))
wage_equation <- lm(y ~ x, df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(selection_equation, wage_equation), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

- Clearly, the estimates are biased since $cov(U_i, V_i) \neq 0$

---

# Sample selection model: assumptions

To estimate the sample selection model, distributional assumptions on the disturbances terms are made, such as bivariate normality

\begin{align*}
  \left[\begin{array}{l}
    U_{i} \\
    V_{i}
  \end{array}\right] \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    \sigma^{2} & \rho \sigma \\
    \rho \sigma & 1
  \end{array}\right]\right)
\end{align*}

- Note that the variance of the normal distribution is not identified in the probit model so it is set to 1
- To solve the sample selection problem, one needs to use Heckman selection model (left as an exercise in the first assignment)
- Heckman estimator is very similar to the Tobit estimator 
- The difference is that this estimator allows for a set of characteristics that determine whether or not the outcome variable is censored

---

# Weak instrument problem

- If $Z$ has only a trivial effect on $X$, then it's not *relevant* - even if it's truly exogenous, it does not matter because there's no variation in $X$ we can isolate with it
- And our small-sample bias will be big
- Thus, weak instrument problem means that we probably shouldn't be using IV in small samples
- This also means that it's really important that $cov(X, Z)$ is not small
- There are some rules of thumb for how strong an instrument must be to be counted as "not weak"
- A t-statistic above 3, or an F statistic from a joint test of the instruments that is 10 or above
- These rules of thumb aren't great - selecting a model on the basis of significance naturally biases your results
- What you really want is to know the *population* effect of $Z$ on $X$ - you want the F-statistic from *that* to be 10+. Of course we don't actually know that

---

# Weak instrument problem: simulation

- Let's look at the output of `feols()` using a simulated dataset

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(fabricatr)
set.seed(777)

df <- tibble(Y = rpois(200, lambda = 4),
             Z = rbinom(200, 1, prob = 0.4),
             X1 = Z * rbinom(200, 1, prob = 0.8),
             X2 = rnorm(200),
             G = sample(letters[1:4], 200, replace = TRUE))
```

---

# Weak instrument problem: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
iv <- feols(Y ~ X2 | X1 ~ Z, data = df, se = 'hetero')
thef <- fitstat(iv, 'ivf', verbose = FALSE)$`ivf1::X1`$stat
iv
```

- `r scales::number(thef, accuracy = .01)` is way above 10! We're probably fine in this particular regression

---

# Overidentification tests

- "Overidentification" just means we have more identifying conditions (validity assumptions) than we actually need. We only need one instrument, but we have two (or more)
- So we can compare what we get using each instrument individually
- If we assume that *at least one of them is valid*, and they both produce similar results, then that's evidence that *both* are valid

---

# Overidentification tests: simulation

- We can do this using `diagnostics = TRUE` in `iv_robust` again

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
# Create data where Z1 is valid and Z2 is invalid
df <- tibble(Z1 = rnorm(1000), Z2 = rnorm(1000),
             X = Z1 + Z2 + rnorm(1000),
             # True effect is 1
             Y = X + Z2 + rnorm(1000))

iv <- feols(Y ~ 1 | X ~ Z1 + Z2, data = df, se = 'hetero')
fitstat(iv, 'sargan')
```

- That's a small p-value. We can reject that the results are similar for each IV, telling us that one is endogenous (although without seeing the actual data generating process we couldn't guess if it were $Z1$ or $Z2$ )

---

# Overidentification tests: simulation

- How different are they? What did the test see that it was comparing? 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
iv1 <- feols(Y ~ 1 | X ~ Z1, data = df)
iv2 <- feols(Y ~ 1 | X ~ Z2, data = df)
export_summs(iv1, iv2, statistics = c(N = 'nobs'))
```

Notice the first model gives an accurate coefficient of 1

---

# Quantile regression

- Consider the very simple OLS version testing this model using the experimental data:
\begin{align*}
  Y_i = \alpha + D_i ' \beta + U_i
\end{align*}
where $Y_i$ is an outcome variable, $D_i$ is a tretment variable
- Recall that this will estimate our ATE for the treatment
- What is the interpretation of this affect?
  - $E(Y_i (1)) - E(Y_i (0))$, i.e. the expected change in the outcome for a person moving from untreated to treated. That’s a useful metric
- In other words, it characterizes features of the **mean** of our outcome variable, conditional on covariates

---

# Quantile regression

- What if we care about other things but the mean?
- Quantile regression also solves the problems with
  - Skewed variables – no more worrying about logs or outliers in the outcome variable
  - Censoring – in many datasets, our outcome variables are top-coded or bottom-coded
- But it has its own issues
  - it is noisier
  - it is challenging to interpret in an intuitive way
- If you have underlying theory that has implications for distribution, quantile regression is the rigth tool for empirical analysis

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(x = seq(0, 100, length.out = 100),
             # non-constant variance
             sig = 0.1 + 0.05 * x,
             y = 6 + 0.1 * x + rnorm(100,mean = 0, sd = sig))
```

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

Let's simulate the dataset with normal random error with non-constant variance

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  theme_light() + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

- We can see the increasing variability: as $X$ gets bigger, $Y$ becomes more variable

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

- The estimated mean conditional on $X$ is still unbiased, but it doesn’t tell us much about the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, especially as $X$ gets larger
- To perform quantile regression, use the `quantreg` package and specify $\text{tau}$ - the quantile you are interested in

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(quantreg)
qr <- rq(y ~ x, df, tau = 0.9)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary.rq(qr)
```

- The $X$ coefficient estimate of `r round(qr[["coefficients"]][["x"]], 3)` says "one unit increase in $X$ is associated with `r round(qr[["coefficients"]][["x"]], 3)` increase in the $90$ quantile of $Y$"
- The "lower bd" and "upper bd" values are confidence intervals calculated using the "rank" method  (to read more about calculating confidence intervals, use `?summary.rq`)

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qr2 <- rq(y ~ x, data = df, tau = seq(.1, .9, by = .1))
summary.rq(qr2)
```

- The intercept estimate doesn’t change much but the slopes steadily increase

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

- Let's plot our quantile estimates

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_quantile(quantiles = seq(.1, .9, by = .1))
```

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(summary(qr2), parm = "x")
```

- Each black dot is the slope coefficient for the quantile indicated on the x axis. The red lines are the least squares estimate and its confidence interval
- You can see how the lower and upper quartiles are well beyond the least squares estimate

---

# Quantile regression: inference

- There are several alternative methods of conducting inference about quantile regression coefficients
  - rank-inversion confidence intervals: `summary.rq(qr)` 
  - more conventional standard errors: `summary.rq(qr, se = "nid")`
  - bootstraped stanard errors: `summary.rq(qr, se = "boot")`
